# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  
- Completed Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 and Introduction to Basic CSS
of FreeCodeCamp.org Responsive Web Design Certification.  
- Started Introduction to JavaScript of FreeCodeCamp.org Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification

**Thoughts**  
I've been dabbling with html and css for a while now. I'm working through the Responsive Web Design Certification mainly as a refresher, and way overdue to start learning JavaScript!
